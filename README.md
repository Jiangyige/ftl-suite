#Freemarker Development Suite (ftl-suite)
> Make front-end freemarker template developing efficiently and conveniently

## How to use, only 3 steps:
1. Make sure Java is installed on your machine (version 1.4 or later)
2. Install ftl-suite `npm install ftl-suite --save-dev`
3. Start services `[PORT=80] node node_modules/ftl-suite`

## Feature
1. Render ftl files in local server without IDE
2. According to the interface document mock data, parallel development with back-end
3. Proxy Ajax to the remote server
4. URL Rewrite
5. Restore the online environment perfectly

## Configurations
When you start the service for the first time, ftl-suite will create a config file named **fsconfig.json**. You can edit it directly or visit http://127.0.0.1/mockadmin/ (Add the Port if it is not 80)

Default config:
```
{
    ftlRoot: 'ftl',
    remoteHost: '',
    proxyPre: '',
    proxyArr: [],
    route: {}
}
```

### ftlRoot
freemarker root folder, E.g.
```
ftl
../main/ftl
....
```

### remoteHost
Ajax remote server, Support URL and IP, E.g.
```
xx.com
http://xx.com
https://xx.com
123.123.123.123
http://123.123.123.123
....
```

### proxyPre
Prefix of proxy URL, E.g.
```
single:
api => /api/xxx/xxx
ajax => /ajax/xxx/xxx

multiple:
(api|ajax) => /(api|ajax)/xxx/xxx
```

### proxyArr
Customize URLs need to proxy, E.g.
```
[
    "/api/login/info",
    "/api/login/check"
]
```

### route
URL Rewrite map, E.g.
```
{
    "/user/home": "/html/user/home/main.html"
}
```

**You can edit all configurations by visiting http://127.0.0.1/mockadmin/**

## Rendering
When you visit an URL in browser, the service will find the appropriate FTL, rendering from a json file in the same path in "mock/data".

E.g.

```
visit: /main/index.html
ftl: /ftl/main/index.ftl
data: /mock/data/main/index.json
```

## Note
1. Prefixed with "static|src|mock|html?|tools?" will return static files
2. To avoid errors, it is recommended to use the "mockadmin" to edit configuration
3. You can find more surprise in index.js
